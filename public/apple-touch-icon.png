# Apple Touch Icon Instructions

This file should be replaced with a 180x180 PNG image of your favicon.

To generate the Apple touch icon:

1. Use the favicon.svg as a base
2. Convert it to a 180x180 PNG image
3. Ensure it has a transparent or white background
4. The design should be the same as the SVG favicon

You can use online tools like:
- https://convertio.co/svg-png/
- https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
- Or any image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or Figma

The icon should represent the AI/neural network theme with blue and teal gradients.
